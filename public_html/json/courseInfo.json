This enables students to understand the maturity and limitations of various analysis techniques.","vector":"[3-0-0:3]","attributes":null,"attributes_popup":null,"matching":null,"sections":[{"section":"L1","classnum":"1089","datetime":["TuTh 04:30PM - 05:50PM"],"room":"Rm 4505, Lift 25-26 (64)","instructor":["CHEUNG, Shing Chi"],"quota":{"all":"50","details":[]},"enrol":"0","avail":"50","wait":"0","remarks":""}],"credit":"3"},"COMP5213":{"code":"COMP5213","name":"Introduction to Bayesian Networks","prerequisite":null,"exclusion":null,"prevcode":"COMP 538","description":"Bayesian networks and probabilistic modeling of complex domains; conditional independence and graph separation; variable elimination, clique tree propagation, and other inference algorithms; parameter learning; structure learning; latent structure models; recent developments.","vector":"[3-0-0:3]","attributes":null,"attributes_popup":null,"matching":null,"sections":[{"section":"L1","classnum":"1090","datetime":["WeFr 01:30PM - 02:50PM"],"room":"Rm 3584, Lift 27-28 (30)","instructor":["ZHANG, Nevin Lianwen"],"quota":{"all":"30","details":[]},"enrol":"0","avail":"30","wait":"0","remarks":""}],"credit":"3"},"COMP5331":{"code":"COMP5331","name":"Knowledge Discovery in Databases","prerequisite":null,"exclusion":null,"prevcode":"COMP 537","description":"An introduction to knowledge discovery in databases.
